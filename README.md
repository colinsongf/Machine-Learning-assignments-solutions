Solutions to Machine Learning coursera MOOC

This course was instructed by Professor Andrew Ng of Stanford. The course introduced various concepts in machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition. The major topics covered in this course were supervised learning (linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, Support Vector Machines), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction using k-means and PCA, anomaly detection systems and recommender systems). I completed this course on September 30, 2014 with 100% final grade.This repository contains solutions to the assignments I completed while working on this course.
